# Interoperability

We are working to ensure that CORNETO is interoperable with many other Python libraries for the analysis of biological data based on biological networks and prior knowledge.

The philosophy behind CORNETO is to provide a library with minimal dependencies that allows for modeling biological network problems at various levels, while also offering support with other community tools through the use of optional dependencies.

Here is a list of some of the extensions we are developing for CORNETO to expand the library's capabilities for complex use cases.
