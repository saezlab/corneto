# Install

**CORNETO** provides flexible installation options depending on your needs. It integrates with various mathematical optimization solvers, which differ in their licensing, capabilities, and performance. Below are several installation options tailored to different use cases.

## üîß Quick Installation

To get started quickly with open-source solvers, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git@dev scipy pyscipopt highspy cvxpy
```

This installs:
- **CORNETO** (from the development branch)
- **PySCIPOpt**: a Python interface for SCIP (a fast open-source solver)
- **highspy**: Python bindings for the HIGHs solver
- **CVXPY**: a modeling language for convex optimization problems

These libraries provide solid performance for most users and don‚Äôt require a commercial license.

---

## üß© Installation Options

### Basic Installation (CORNETO only)

If you only want the core CORNETO package without any solver backend (useful for development or adding solvers manually later):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git@dev
```

You‚Äôll need to install and configure a solver separately to make CORNETO fully functional.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation with Commercial Solvers

If you have access to **Gurobi** (a powerful commercial solver, free for academic use), you can install CORNETO along with Gurobi and its supported modeling tools:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git@dev cvxpy gurobipy
```

**Note:** Make sure you have a valid Gurobi license set up on your system. You can get a free academic license [here](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).

---

### üÜì Installation with Open-Source Solvers

Prefer open-source? This installs CORNETO with:
- **SCIP** (via `pyscipopt`)
- **HIGHs** (via `highspy`)
- **CVXPY**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git@dev scipy pyscipopt highspy cvxpy
```

These tools are effective and don't require any licensing setup.

---

### üß™ Alternative Backend: PICOS

CORNETO also supports `picos`, another modeling layer for optimization. You can install CORNETO with `picos` and several solvers it supports:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git@dev scipy picos swiglpk qics
```

This setup uses:
- **PICOS**: a high-level modeling tool
- **swiglpk**: Python bindings for GLPK, a lightweight solver
- **qics**: another solver supported by PICOS

---

## ‚úÖ Verifying Installation

To check that CORNETO is installed and ready:

```python
import corneto

corneto.info()
```

This should print out CORNETO version info and configuration details.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

If you run into installation problems:

1. ‚úÖ Make sure you're using **Python 3.10 or higher**
2. üß± Check that you have at least **cvxpy** installed as a backend (this is the recommended one)
3. üîë For Gurobi users, verify that your **license is properly installed**

In case of using Gurobi, you can check if the license and installation are correct by running:

```python
from corneto.utils import check_gurobi
check_gurobi()
```

This will perform a series of checks to ensure that Gurobi is correctly installed and configured. You should see:

```plain
Gurobipy successfully imported.
Gurobi environment started successfully.
Starting optimization of the test model...
Test optimization was successful.
Gurobi environment disposed.
Gurobi is correctly installed and working.
```
